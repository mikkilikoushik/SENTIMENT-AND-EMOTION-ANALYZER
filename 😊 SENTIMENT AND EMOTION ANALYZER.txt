üòä SENTIMENT AND EMOTION ANALYZER
Name: Mikkili Koushik 
Type: Micro IT Project

‚úÖ Introduction
This project is a basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) application built using Python. It analyzes the emotional tone and sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of a given text input. It combines lexical analysis (emotion detection) with sentiment scoring using pre-built NLP tools, and presents results in a visual format.

üéØ Objective of the Project
Understand text preprocessing using Python.

Analyze text for emotions using an emotion lexicon.

Classify input text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

Visualize emotional frequencies using bar graphs.

Gain familiarity with NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and data visualization.

üß∞ Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

nltk ‚Äì for tokenization, stop words, and sentiment analysis

matplotlib ‚Äì for graph plotting

collections.Counter ‚Äì to count frequency of emotions

string ‚Äì for punctuation removal

External Files:

emotions.txt ‚Äì emotion lexicon containing words and associated emotions

üß© System Design and Architecture
Text Flow:

Accepts user input (or file input).

Converts to lowercase and removes punctuation.

Tokenizes and removes stopwords.

Matches remaining words with emotion lexicon.

Counts emotion frequencies and plots a bar chart.

Uses VADER sentiment analyzer to determine overall sentiment.

User Interface:

CLI-based interface (terminal/console).

Prompts for user input.

Displays results in terminal and via a matplotlib graph.

üíª Implementation Details
1. Preprocessing:

Converts text to lowercase.

Removes punctuation using str.translate.

Tokenizes words with nltk.word_tokenize.

Filters out stopwords using nltk.corpus.stopwords.

2. Emotion Detection:

Reads the emotions.txt file line-by-line.

Matches cleaned words to entries in the emotion lexicon.

Appends detected emotions to a list.

Counts occurrences with Counter().

3. Visualization:

Plots a bar chart of emotion frequencies using matplotlib.

4. Sentiment Analysis:

Uses SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from nltk.sentiment.vader.

Compares positive and negative scores:

Higher positive ‚Üí Positive review

Higher negative ‚Üí Negative review

Equal ‚Üí Neutral review

üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
Handling stopword removal and punctuation cleaning.

Ensuring accurate parsing of the emotion lexicon file.

Mapping emotions correctly to tokens.

Interpreting sentiment polarity from VADER output.

üìö Learning Outcomes
Gained practical experience with NLP tasks in Python.

Understood how to use and clean real-world textual data.

Learned basic sentiment analysis using NLTK‚Äôs VADER tool.

Practiced visualizing data with Python plots.

Understood the importance of text preprocessing.

‚úÖ Conclusion
This project successfully integrates multiple text analysis techniques to evaluate user input. It combines both emotion detection from a lexicon and sentiment scoring using a machine learning-based approach. The graphical representation enhances understanding and interpretation.

üöÄ Future Scope
Allow input from files or larger text corpora (e.g., articles, reviews).

Enhance emotion lexicon with more words.

Export results to a CSV or report.

Build a GUI using Tkinter or Flask for web interaction.

Add support for multiple languages using translation APIs.
